# rapise-jenkins-standalone

This project's intention is to demonstrate execution of Rapise GUI tests directly from Jenkins. 

Recommended approach is to use SpiraTest and RapiseLauncher designied for this task. In some cases it is not an option and we need to execute a test directly. That is what we are doing here.

TBD
